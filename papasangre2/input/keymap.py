"""Rebindable keyboard bindings.

The iOS original had no keyboard, so the *bindings* are new; the **actions**
are not - each one corresponds to something the original's
``PGEMoveInterpretor`` or view controllers could do, so gameplay code only ever
talks about actions and never about keys.

Bindings live in ``config/keys.json`` next to the executable, so they can be
changed without touching gameplay code.
